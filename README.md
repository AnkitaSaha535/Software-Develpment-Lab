Software Development Lab

Welcome to my technical workspace. This repository serves as a portfolio of my programming journey, featuring projects that focus on algorithmic logic, system security, and automation.

Core Competencies
Languages: Python, Java, C

Focus Areas: Software Logic, Security Validation, Data Processing, User-Centric Design

Key Projects
1. Security & Validation
Password Strength Checker (Java): A robust security tool utilizing loops and regex patterns to validate password complexity, including length, casing, and special character requirements.

Random Password Generator (Python): A utility tool that creates high-entropy, secure strings for data protection.

2. Automation & Data Handling
Smart Expense Tracker (Python): A file-handling application that logs spending and triggers budget alerts based on historical data analysis.

Student Grade System (Java): An array-based processing tool for calculating academic performance and statistical distribution.

3. Algorithmic Logic
Palindrome Analyzer (C): A memory-efficient program focusing on string manipulation and array traversal.

Number Logic Engine (Python): A dynamic conditional-loop game designed to test computational logic.

Multi-Function Calculator (C): A switch-case implementation for arithmetic operations and input handling.
